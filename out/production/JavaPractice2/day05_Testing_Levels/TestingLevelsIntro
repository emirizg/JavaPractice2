   - Integration Testing
   - System Testing
   - UAT - User Acceptance Testing

   1.Unit Testing     also called Module testing/Component Testing
      - testing the small unit / individual module of the app from the code perspective

      Who: Developers, they write code unit by unit
      Env: The Dev environment

      unit testing is part of white box testing

      once the unit testing is done and everything is fine individually

   2.Integration Testing
     - it's testting 2 or more modules of the appliaction and see if they work together or not.

       Do you have experience performing integration testing?
         - no, I do not have experience, in my project, our dev performed the integration testin. But I am willing to learn it.
         - Some SDETs have this knowledge so because its not required in my project that's why I didn't get the chance to learn it
         but I am willing to learn in this company, that's why i am in the market to looking for new opportinty,i want to improve myself

         developers deploy their codes from the Dev to the QA env.

     - System testing id divided into: 1. Functional testing

                                          Who:SDET/QA
                                          env: in the QA/TEST environment
